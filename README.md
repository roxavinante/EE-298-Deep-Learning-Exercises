#### Assignment #1: Gradient Descent For Linear Regression
**Problem:**
Implement in python3 and numpy the gradient descent for linear regression of arbitrary polynomial function. 
The program is activated by:

python3 [linreg.py](https://github.com/roxavinante/EE-298-Deep-Learning-Exercises/blob/master/linreg.py) 2 4 -1

Where the arguments are the coefficients of the polynomial (ie 2x^2 + 4x - 1) . 
To prove its robustness against noise on input and output, add uniform distribution noise from the unit sphere. 
Expect up to 3rd deg polynomial.

What is the recommended learning rate?
